# Computer Vision (H02A5a)

## Assignment 1: Basic image processing
Apply some basic image processing techniques to a one minute video using the OpenCV library. 
Show the video in grayscale as a baseline, choose one simple filter (e.g. Gaussian) and increase the effect of the blurring by widening the filter kernel, smoothing filter to preserve the edges (e.g. bilateral filter), grab an object in an RGB color space, grab an object in HSV color space, improve grabbing (e.g. fill holes, undetected edges) by using binary morphological operations, finally add extra magic to the scene, e.g: change color.

## Assignment 2: Towards object detection
Expands on techniques for grabbing an object by first building features that capture properties of an object and then using these features to detect this object. You will explore edge detection, detection of particular shapes (here, circles) and finally use feature descriptors to detect an object of interest via a technique called template matching.
