# Computer Vision (H02A5a)

## Assignment 1: Basic image processing


## Assignment 2: Towards object detection
Expands on techniques for grabbing an object by first building features that capture properties of an object and then using these features to detect this object. You will explore edge detection, detection of particular shapes (here, circles) and finally use feature descriptors to detect an object of interest via a technique called template matching.
